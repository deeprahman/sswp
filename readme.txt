Enhance WordPress security by setting recommended file permissions, securing .htaccess, and disabling sensitive endpoints.

== Description ==
**Securing Setup** helps protect your WordPress installation by:
1. Allowing users to set recommended file permissions for directories and subdirectories.
2. Automatically modifying the `.htaccess` file to:
   - Protect the `debug.log` file from being accessed via the web.
   - Restrict execution of specific file types (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`), ensuring only selected file types are processed by the web server.
3. Disabling sensitive WordPress endpoints such as:
   - `system.multicall` from XML-RPC.
   - The `users` endpoint in the REST API.

The plugin is user-friendly and includes an easy-to-access settings page.
